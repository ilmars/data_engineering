    "Follow instructions in the ``etl.ipynb`` notebook to develop ETL processes for each table. At the end of each table section, or at the end of the notebook, run ``test.ipynb`` to confirm that records were successfully inserted into each table. Remember to rerun ``create_tables.py`` to reset your tables before each time you run this notebook.\n",

    "## Build ETL Pipeline\n",
    "Use what you've completed in ``etl.ipynb`` to complete ``etl.py``, where you'll process the entire datasets. Remember to run ``create_tables.py`` before running ``etl.py`` to reset your tables. Run ``test.ipynb`` to confirm your records were successfully inserted into each table.\n",
